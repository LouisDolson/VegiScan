## VegiScan

Vegetables are a vital component of a balanced diet, yet assessing their quality and understanding their health benefits can be challenging for home cooks. Poor knowledge of vegetable freshness often leads to food waste and missed opportunities for creating nutritious meals. To address these challenges, we created “VegiScan,” a smart AI-based system designed specifically for home cooks to diagnose vegetable quality and provide personalized recipe recommendations based on available ingredients. Leveraging AI technology, VegiScan identifies key parameters affecting vegetable quality and links this diagnosis to practical solutions, such as tailored recipes to maximize ingredient use. By empowering home cooks to reduce food waste and make the most of their produce, VegiScan offers an innovative solution that promotes sustainability and healthier eating habits.
